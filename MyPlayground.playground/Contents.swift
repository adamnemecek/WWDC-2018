// ATTENTION:
/*
 At first, Playground shows an error that PlaygroundBuilder was not found.
 (Playground loads files but does not compile them on my machine)
 
 Please RESTART the playground and enter space into the main and any source file.
 It will start the compilation process and an error will not be shown as all sources will be loaded.
 
 In addition, please make sure that the screen size is equal or greater than 768x768
 
 Thanks!
