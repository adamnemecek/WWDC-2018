The message will be shown when the sorting is done.\n\nYou can repeat the sorting as many times as you wish.";

I am interested in open source projects and share my Swift libraries on GitHub. My goal is to advance my knowledge in computer science, data structures, and algorithms.";

So I decided to create a proof of concept and use it as a base for the full-fledged app in the future.\n\nThis app animates how three the most widespread sorting algorithms work:\nSelection, Quick and Bubble sorts.\n\nTo be honest, the idea came to me 2 days before the end of submissions so that is why I implemented only 3 sorting algorithm animations.\n\nI hope you will enjoy the idea.\n\ndevMEremenko@gmail.com\ngithub.com/devMEremenko\nlinkedin.com/in/maxim-eremenko/";
